# Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Key Benefits

- Encapsulates object creation logic
- Provides a way to create objects without exposing creation logic
- Allows for flexibility in object creation
- Makes code more maintainable and scalable

## Types of Factory Patterns

1. **Simple Factory**

   - Basic factory that creates objects based on input parameters
   - Simplest form of factory pattern

2. **Factory Method**

   - Defines an interface for creating objects
   - Lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate
   - Promotes loose coupling

3. **Abstract Factory**
   - Creates families of related objects
   - Provides an interface for creating families of dependent objects
   - Highest level of abstraction

## When to Use

- When object creation involves complex logic
- When you need to create different variations of objects
- When you want to centralize object creation logic
- When working with collections of related objects

## Example Use Cases

- UI Component creation
- Database connectors
- File format handlers
- Configuration objects
