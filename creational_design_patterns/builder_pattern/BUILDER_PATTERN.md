# Builder Design Pattern

## Overview

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. It's particularly useful when you need to create an object with numerous possible configurations.

## Components

1. **Product (Pizza)**

   - The complex object being built

2. **Builder (PizzaBuilder)**

   - Specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of the Product object

3. **Director (PizzaDirector)**
   - Constructs the object using the Builder interface

## Benefits

- Allows you to construct objects step-by-step
- Can reuse the same construction code for different representations
- Single Responsibility Principle: isolates complex construction code from business logic

## Example Usage

```javascript
const director = new PizzaDirector();
const hawaiianPizza = director.constructHawaiianPizza();
```

## When to Use

- When you need to create complex objects with multiple parts
- When you want to create different representations of the same object
- When you need fine control over the construction process

## Implementation Details

The implementation in this project demonstrates:

- Fluent interface (method chaining)
- Flexible construction process
- Separation of concerns between construction and representation
