ðŸŽ¯ What is the Bridge Pattern?
The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to evolve independently.

Key Benefits:
âœ” Allows different parts of the system (e.g., a remote control and a device) to change separately.
âœ” Helps avoid class explosion caused by multiple variations of abstractions and implementations.
âœ” Improves scalability and maintainability.

ðŸ“º Real-World Example: Universal Remote & Home Devices
Imagine you have a universal remote that can control multiple devices like TVs and DVD players.

The remote control is the abstraction (interface that users interact with).
The TV/DVD player is the implementation (actual device behavior).
The bridge is the link between the remote and the device, allowing them to vary independently.
