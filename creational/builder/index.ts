Builder: The Custom Smartphone Workshop
Definition
The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that allows step-by-step construction of complex objects, ensuring readability, flexibility, and avoiding constructor overloads

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. Instead of using a large constructor with many parameters, it allows us to create objects in a structured and readable way.

Scenario
Your smartphone factory empire has decided to open a new division: a "Custom Smartphone Workshop." Here, customers can design their dream smartphones by choosing specific components like the screen size, battery capacity, camera quality, and storage capacity. Instead of producing pre-configured phones, the workshop lets customers build their phones step-by-step, ensuring they only add the features they want. For example, one customer might want a compact iPhone with a huge battery, while another wants a Samsung with a massive screen and top-tier camera.

The challenge is to avoid a "monster constructor" with dozens of parameters (e.g., new Smartphone(screenSize, battery, camera, storage, ...)), which would be hard to use and error-prone. The Builder pattern solves this by providing a "smartphone builder" that lets customers add components one at a time, then assembles the final phone when they‚Äôre ready.

Key Idea
The Builder pattern is like a custom car workshop where you pick and choose parts (engine, wheels, paint color) to build your dream car. In the smartphone context, the builder acts as a "construction manager" that collects all the customer‚Äôs choices and assembles the final phone, ensuring the process is flexible, readable, and easy to extend (e.g., adding new components like waterproofing or foldable screens).

Real-Life Vibe
Picture a high-tech workshop with a friendly robot assistant (the builder). You walk in, and the robot asks, ‚ÄúWhat screen size would you like? What about battery capacity? Any special camera features?‚Äù You answer step-by-step, and when you‚Äôre done, the robot assembles your custom smartphone, perfectly tailored to your needs. If a new feature like augmented reality (AR) cameras becomes available, the workshop can easily add it to the menu without changing how existing phones are built.
