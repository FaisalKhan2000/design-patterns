# Design Patterns Implementation

https://roadmap.sh/guides/design-patterns-for-humans

This repository demonstrates various design patterns implemented in javascript. Each pattern serves as a practical example of solving common software design challenges.

## Implemented Patterns

### Creational Patterns

- Factory Pattern: Creates objects without exposing creation logic
- Singleton Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance
- Builder Pattern: Constructs complex objects step by step

### Structural Patterns

- Adapter Pattern: Makes incompatible interfaces work together
- Bridge Pattern: Separates an abstraction from its implementation
- Decorator Pattern: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically

### Behavioral Patterns

- Observer Pattern: Defines one-to-many dependency between objects
- Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms
- Command Pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object

## Usage

Each pattern includes:

- Implementation code
- Example usage
- Brief explanation of the pattern's purpose
- Common use cases

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Visual Studio
3. Run examples in each pattern's folder

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please feel free to:

- Add new patterns
- Improve existing implementations
- Fix bugs
